Code works sufficiently well, though takes about 45 minutes to an hour with screen on on a computer using 3.5 GHz processor running OS 10.10.5 for iMacs for each w value. Tried to circumvent this by terminating sweeps if normalized residual value for Psi did not change after 100 sweeps, implying that it converged, which vaguely helps. Unclear how to make this shorter without evaluating less data points (therefore losing information).
